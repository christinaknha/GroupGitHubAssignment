#### Christina Ha
_I have learned quite a bit this week but I think the most interesting has to be how to use the git functions. 
I still have difficulty visualizing what the code is doing and if it is doing what I want it to correctly._

This week I learned how to use _Italics_ in markdown and numerous git commands.

## Alexander Forward
This week I learned how to use _git through visual studio_ to collaborate with my team. This skill will definitely come in handy in the future when I am 
working with others on the same project.
